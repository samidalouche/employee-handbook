# Core Values

## Transparency is always better than opacity
Everyone working at Narrative needs to be able to quickly act to various business situations.  In order for them to do that effectively they need access to all of the expertice and information that exists within the organization, somethign that is not possible if there is a culture opacity.  We will strive to be transparent in evertyhing we do.

## All team members are equals
While members of the organization will have different skill sets, personality types, and seniority levels no one person on the team is better than any other person.  We will treat each other with respect, listen to all opinions, and harness the value of a strong collective team.

## Make quick decisions and then change course as needed
Many organization become paralyzed by their inability to make decisions.  To quote the Aaron Sorkin "every once in a while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost always include body counts."  This same principle holds when running a business.  Most decisions don't have a right and a wrong.  In fact most decisions aren't binary at all.  As an organization we should prefer making decisions quick, well informed decisions, implementing those decisions and the course correct as needed.  This is almost always preferable to taking a long time to make a decision and still having to course correct afterwards.
