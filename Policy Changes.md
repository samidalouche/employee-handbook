# Policy Changes

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

## Platforms and Tools

We’re using several different tools and platforms to collect feedback and discuss the handbook. 

### Github

The handbook is hosted on Github, and anyone with a Github account can make an issue or open a pull request. This is an important home for the project, and we want to encourage and reward participation. We should respond to issues and comments here and use the edits in pull requests when they’re appropriate. Our leadership team will do this regularly, and anyone else is free to respond when they're interested. This will help more people feel bought into the handbook and will help us gather more opinions on our policies.

However, our internal processing does not need to happen on Github. Anyone should feel free to post their thoughts on Github, but there are a lot of sensitive topics that we’ll want to discuss internally. When we make changes, they should be merged on Github and we should explain our rationale there, but we don’t need to rehash the whole conversation.

Github is a tool that the technical members of our team will already be familiar with, but special consideration should be taken to make sure our non-technical teammates have accounts and understand how to participate there.

### Twitter

A lot of folks have commented on the handbook outside of Github, especially on Twitter. The best thing for us to do is acknowledge their input and make sure it gets recorded in one of our other channels (especially Github) so that we don’t lose it. As individuals, anyone should feel free to talk about their opinions about feedback, but as Clef we should thank people for their input without being defensive.

### Slack #employee-handbook

This channel is a good place for us to comment on policy changes asynchronously. Any questions, concerns, ideas, or discussion about our handbook can go here. If a conversation seems particularly interesting, we'll document it in Google docs or in a Github issue for future reference.  Any updates to the Github repository will be cross posted in the Slack channel.
