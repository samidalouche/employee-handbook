# Narrative Employee Handbook
Although clich√© we feel that our company culture can be one of our biggest assets.  As we begin to grow the team we felt it important to have a document that would outline Narrative's mission, values, process and procedures.  In an effort to not recreate the wheel this document is largely based on [Clef's employee handbook](https://github.com/clef/handbook) which was recently open sourced.

As Narrative is in its infancy, so is this document.  As the company grows so will this handbook.  It is intended to be a living document and we want all employees to contribute to its content, just like we want everyone at the company to contribute and help mold our culture.

Please reach out if you ever want to discuss.
